# Colored Portraits

John Henry Thompson
2021

3 interactive video works on 5 screens

- Facets (2 screens)
- Color Line 1900 (1 screen)
- Skin Tone (2 screens)

The Colored Portraits installation explores the possibilities of experimentation and innovation in computing and video art by investigating the creative potential of filtering live video. Evolving from an adaptation of the
[iOS native app DICE](http://www.johnhenrythompson.com/3-dice)
to the ubiquitous, browser based art-making program,
[p5js](https://p5js.org),
Colored Portraits is born of a desire (that runs throughout John Henry’s work) to facilitate art making with computing devices in ways that are accessible to artists and creators everywhere.

Colored Portraits is a natural evolution of JHT’s creative explorations with long-time collaborator Benjamin Bergery as they seek to create fresh experiences for humans interacting with the computer to learn something new about themselves and the world around them.

from the “YOGA SYSTEM OF PATANJALI”

The goal is to make everything that is experienced in this installation into an educational platform accessible through the browser. The code for this project will be available as an open source repository to encourage further development.

## Technology - How I built this

Broadly speaking, what I am exploring here is a platform to easily apply video effects to live video streams whether the video is local or on the Internet.
Technologies:

- [p5js - a javascript library](https://p5js.org) that makes it easier for people who do not have a mathematical or engineering background to harness the creative potential of the computer by programming in the browser.
- [ml5js, a machine learning library](https://ml5js.org) for facial recognition, packaged together by people from ITP to make it compatible with - - p5js. ml5js builds on [TensorFlow js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
- [Live Video library](https://github.com/vanevery/p5LiveMedia) created by Shawn Van Every.
