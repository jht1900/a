# Facets

FACETS is a two-screen experience:

## Front Screen:

In FACETS the observer is shown in the center square as a black and white grid. Clockwise around the center are different video filters applied to the observer.

FACETS reflects JHTâ€™s exploration of the structure of the pixel and how colors look on the computer, through real time video processing techniques that provides the user with different ways of seeing the same thing. In FACETS JHT employs creative filters for portraits - portraiture making - that captures aspects of a person but is deliberately not representational.

## Back Screen:

Deeply pixelated and [mathematical convoluted](https://www.dspguide.com/ch6/2.htm) image of the observer and surroundings.
