COVID MEMORIAL TICKER: Remembering in the Midst
At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic my partner, Shindy Johnson, and I contemplated a response to the ever growing global impact on the lives of essential workers and the most vulnerable African-American and LatinX demographic within that population. More than anything, we were concerned that the lives lost were not relegated to the status of a statistic, and that the grieving survivors did not feel alone, isolated and unseen.

The [Covid Impact Project](https://covid19impactproject.com/) and [COVID-19-Impact Dashboard](https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Dashboard/a0/) were born.

Which led to:

[The COVID-19 Impact Project: Extracting Stories From Data](https://covid19impactproject.com/extracting-stories-from-data/), 2021 Feb NYU-ITP Course.

[The Covid Memorial Ticker](https://jht1493.net/a1/skt/covid19_heal_ticker), this installation.

How can a public memorial be presented for the many who have died (and will die) from the COVID-19 pandemic? The COVID Memorial Ticker explores one possibility as an installation in a secluded corner hallway on the floor of NYU-ITP. Total deaths in the USA per day from COVID-19 are displayed as simple squares. The death count for yesterday is shown along with the count of each preceding day, back to the beginning of the pandemic - February 2020.

There is a 10 second pause as each day is displayed for a few moments of silence for the deceased.

We have not become numb to the sheer scale of pandemic death in the USA, so we strive to keep the daily numbers in the public consciousness. We hope to communicate the ongoing nature of the pandemic and to let grieving families know that they and their loved ones are not forgotten.
